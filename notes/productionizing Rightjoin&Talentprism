## TalentPrism Bugs

[] AI replied Stop with Stop - https://talentprism.ai/sequence/job-dashboard/7cb95644-9758-4fc5-bb32-196d85611f44?candidateId=34777&tab=activity
[] same url as above - why is recent activity showing sangy and Joe and not other candidates? 

[] why is AI engineer showing 0 interviews even if I had completed one? 
[] Add list of AI interviews 
[] Add link to view all interviews
[] Why sequence null for all commit offshore vapi assistants? 

[*] Improve Vapi - [Needed for Commit offshore and Rightjoin]
[] react components making repeat calls to apis and not caching (job dashbaords)

[] SQL Deep Research Assistant

[] voice profiles - deepgram codeswitching enabled only for caresia and 11labs
[] voice profiles - remove old robotic voices
[] voice profiles - add voice snippets (add this as a service?)
