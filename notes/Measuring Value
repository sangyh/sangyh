THe goal is have a pilot report that clearly demonstrates the value that is otherwise lost in dashboards and emails. The decision makers are not logging into these dashboards or diving into data. They want a clear snapshot within 30 secs. 
So the next immediate goal for me with Talentprism is to demonstrate this value.

An adequate value measuring system - 
- measurable metrics
- change over time

A good value measuring system shows why they should care. What does that mean in their business? Which metric maps to which client business line item?
