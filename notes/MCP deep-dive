## Content
- MCP is a open protocol that enables seamless integration between AI apps and agents and your tools and data sources. 
- Clients are hosts for AI applications. Servers provide federated access to systems and tools that are relevant to the task at hand.

 - Tools are model controlled - model will decide when to invoke functions to take actions
 - Resources are application controlled - constitutes the data exposed to application like files, databases, etc.
 - Prompts are user controlled - user invokes prompt templates (eg. slash commands)

- Agent frameworks design how the LLM performs in a loop and what to do with certain context and when to call for that context, the MCP protocol helps to bring that context to the LLM.
- a key distinction about MCP is that Resources and prompts can dynamic, where an application can subscribe to them, and when a change occurs, the application is notified to take a follow up action.
- the MCP vision extends beyond what context is given to the LLM, to what context is given to the application.
