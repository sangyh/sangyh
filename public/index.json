For hosting the site, I opted for Netlify as it\u0026rsquo;s free, easy to use, and automatically deploys updates with every push to the main branch.\nThe steps are fairly straightforward on the Netlify UI.\nCreate a new site using an existing project from Github.Authorize Netlify to access Github. Next, Netlify will recognize the Hugo site and update the Build command: hugo I had to add an environment variable for the HUGO_VERSION. This is the version of Hugo that Netlify will use to build the site. Not having this was throwing an error as it was trying to use an older version of Hugo. Click deploy.
