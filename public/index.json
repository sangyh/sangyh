[{"content":"Cold emailing is a slightly different skill than writing given the target audience and the time consttraing to capture their attention. So everytime I write to someone, I feel disjointed in where I am on my learning curve and feel like I\u0026rsquo;m starting over again. This post is to track my observations and learnings here.\nA good email So, my starting point here is the following structure for a good cold email.\nWhy you - Why am I messaging you? Why me - Why should you listen to me? Impact - What happens if we work together? Nailing this will hopefully solve the \u0026ldquo;bad email\u0026rdquo; problem and attribute poor response rates to the pitch itself.\nVariations Here are some variations on the components that can be mixed and matched:\nWhy you:\n\u0026ldquo;I noticed your company is hiring for [position]. Are you struggling to find qualified candidates?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;As someone leading [department/function], I imagine you\u0026rsquo;re always looking for ways to improve your hiring process.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Given your experience in [industry], I thought you might be interested in a new approach to candidate screening.\u0026rdquo; Why me:\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve developed an AI-powered interviewing tool that\u0026rsquo;s helping companies like yours save 80% of time spent on initial screenings.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;My background in [relevant field] led me to create a solution that addresses the pain points I experienced firsthand in hiring.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Our platform has already helped [X] companies reduce their time-to-hire by [Y]%.\u0026rdquo; Impact:\n\u0026ldquo;Would you be open to a 15-minute demo to see how we could streamline your hiring process?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d love to show you how our tool could help you identify top candidates faster. When would be a good time for a quick chat?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in cutting your screening time in half, I\u0026rsquo;d be happy to share some case studies from similar companies.\u0026rdquo; Best Practices Personalization: Always tailor the email to the recipient\u0026rsquo;s specific role and company. Brevity: Keep the email concise, ideally no more than 3-4 short paragraphs. Clear CTA: End with a clear, low-commitment call-to-action. Follow-up: Plan for a follow-up sequence if you don\u0026rsquo;t receive a response. Value proposition: Focus on the benefit to the recipient, not just features of your product. Remember, the goal is to start a conversation, not to make a sale in the first email.\nSome templates Adopting this to RightJoin, here are some templates for each component that I can use -\nHi {{firstName}},\n[Why you] As the {{position}}, I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;re aware of the challenges with screening high-volume applications. I came across your profile on LinkedIn and felt your experience was impressive and relevant to the interviewing product I\u0026rsquo;m building.\n[Why me] I am an early-stage founder building an interactive AI interviewing service, that can help HR teams screen high-volume applications. [Impact] Since you\u0026rsquo;re experienced in this space, I\u0026rsquo;d love to learn about common challenges and get your eyes on my product.\nThanks\nHi {{firstName}},\n[Why you] Do you wish you had a way to find the best candidates to your job posting? [Why me] I built RightJoin to save you time by doing the interviews in your industry.\n[Impact] I think you’d be impressed if you saw it work. Can I share a short demo video?\nThanks\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/business/cold-email/","summary":"Cold emailing is a slightly different skill than writing given the target audience and the time consttraing to capture their attention.

To install Hugo on macOS, I ran: brew install hugo For reference, here is Hugo\u0026rsquo;s quick start guide.\nStart a new site with a yaml config using hugo new site my-blog --format yaml I ran this in a www folder in my root directory. This command created a new folder called my-blog with a default config.yaml file. 3. The Next step is to pick a theme. I found that PaperMod was the most popular as seen here. I cloned the theme into my my-blog folder.\ngit clone https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper mod Theme installation instructions are on the github wiki page. I followed the submodule method recommended on the wiki.\nThe last step is to update the config.yaml to include the theme.\ntheme: [PaperMod] Now, running hugo server in the terminal will start a local server at http://localhost:1313/.\nDeploying the blog The first step is to create a Github repository and push the code to it. For hosting the site, I opted for Netlify as it\u0026rsquo;s free, easy to use, and automatically deploys updates with every push to the main branch.\nThe steps are fairly straightforward on the Netlify UI.\nCreate a new site using an existing project from Github.Authorize Netlify to access Github. Next, Netlify will recognize the Hugo site and update the Build command: hugo I had to add an environment variable for the HUGO_VERSION. This is the version of Hugo that Netlify will use to build the site. Not having this was throwing an error as it was trying to use an older version of Hugo. Click deploy. That\u0026rsquo;s it, we have a blog!\nNext steps Add favicon These files need to be in the static folder. I placed them under static/assets/ and updated the config.yaml to include them. assets: disableHLJS: true favicon: \u0026#34;/assets/favicon.ico\u0026#34; favicon16x16: \u0026#34;/assets/favicon-16x16.ico\u0026#34; favicon32x32: \u0026#34;/assets/favicon-32x32.ico\u0026#34; apple_touch_icon: \u0026#34;/assets/apple-touch-icon.png\u0026#34; Add a custom domain [pending] Add analytics [pending] Search engine optimization [pending] ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/tech/easy-blogging-stack/","summary":"I share how I launched this Hugo site in 5 mins, invariably for my future self when I get around to doing it again after having forgetten it.\nSetting up the blog Install Hugo.

But posting on job boards, screening applications and interviewing is a long proces that takes his attention away from his business. He needs a quicker way to go from posting a job to making offers.\nThis is a need for Charlie, and understanding this can help pitch a recruiting product to him.\nContext Amazon advocates for a leadership principle called Customer Obsession, to serves as a constant reminder to put the customer at the center of everything we do. \u0026ldquo;Working backwards from the customer\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; was a commonly used phrase. But fledgeling businesses (like mine) need to overcome an earlier hurdle - who is the customer? Differnet customers have different needs, and serving them needs clear definitions. This is where the term ICP, Ideal Customer Profile, comes in. I have been struggling with identifying my ICP and reading this post by Jason Cohen could help me.\nWhat is the Needs Stack Jason uses the example of AWS/WPEngine/Substack in his post, to drive home the point that customer needs vary based on outcomes and different products position themselves to serve differnet needs across the stack, without competing with each other.\nI will attempt to do the same for the recruiting stack.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get back to Charlie. He\u0026rsquo;s now posted jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed. He gets many interested applicants, let\u0026rsquo;s say 200. He starts looking through resumes, but it quickly gets frustrating. Majority don\u0026rsquo;t seem qualified, or resume looks AI-generated. A few look like a good fit, so he shortlists them. He manages to get through about 50 resumes, having shortlisted 15 applicants and he decides to interview them before looking at more.\nHow would I describe what Carlie did here?\n🤔 Charlie looked at 25% of resumes he received and 15% of them were shortlisted for interviews.\n⭐ But Charlie never wanted to look at 200 resumes. He just wanted to find 5 good candidates.\nCharlie can look for help, he can ask his assistant or hire a recruiter to talk to applicants and screen them. That takes away the burden from him but he has to trust their judgement. Even for them - 200 resumes and 30 secs is 100 minutes of work. If they decide to call 50 for 5 minutes each, that\u0026rsquo;s 250 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for scheduling the calls. So all this adds up to 600 minutes. That\u0026rsquo;s 10 hours!\n🤔 Charlie pays a recruiter for 10 hours of work to screen 200 applicants.\n⭐ But Charlie never wanted to pay for 10 hours of time for screening 200 applicants. He just wanted to find 5 good candidates.\nCharlie then looks for software products to help him find good candidates. He decides to try out a 1-way video interview product. But he has setup the interviews by recording his questions and has to watch 50 video submissions to shortlist 15 candidates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/business/product-positioning/","summary":"Charlie is a business owner, and he frequently needs to hire employees.
