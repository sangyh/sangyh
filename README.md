Hey, it’s me- Sangy
👋🏼 I’m a Data Scientist by profession, previously a civil engineer and currently learning the skills of a web developer.

📈 I’m good at using data science to solve business problems.

👨‍🎓 I have got advanced graduate degrees (MS/PhD) from UT Austin and Georgia Tech in Civil (Geosystems, to be specific) and Computational Science & Engineering. 🤞You don’t want me advising about those cracks in your building foundation🏠(although I can share an awful lot about soil behavior that you didn’t already know). But I can help you with your ML/data science problems

🌇 I'm based in Seattle, WA.

🏃 In my time not spent with family, I enjoy running, listening to podcasts, walking Ollie, my 2-yo lab-mix rescue dog or working at a coffee shop. 

What’s this blog about?
🔨 I enjoy and care deeply about learning new skills. My current goal is to 

👉 build strong fundamental understanding of AI, i.e. large language models, image generation models and the overlapping applications across them.

👉 acquire skills across the board to be able to build, deploy and maintain web apps. This involves Django, Vue js, databases, web hosting... 

✍🏼 I started this blog to document my projects and learning. I plan to write simplified deep dives about technical concepts and my journey building tools using this knowledge.

What I’m working on
🚀 a Twitter tool to help discover similar accounts based on topics/interests that are deciphered from tweets

🚀 a plug-n-play Question-answering bot to serve answers from any knowledge-base

🚀 and few more ideas that need some stress-testing
