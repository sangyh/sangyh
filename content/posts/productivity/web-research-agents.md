I like the idea of haveing a personal agent that can crawl the web and pull relevant information me. 


- It should be able to transcribe my audio. 
- It should be able to accept web pages and hold a conversation about the web page so it will be an interactive voice session. 
- It should be able to commit to Github using Composio .
