We all have the same 24 hours. The question isn't how to fill them—it's how to make them count.

Most people think the path is linear: Work harder → Achieve goals → Find fulfillment.
But what if we're optimizing for the wrong thing?

## The Levels of Leverage

**Level 1: Busy Work**  
Fill 80% of your day grinding. Ship features. Close tickets. Check the box.

**Level 2: Productivity**  
Same output, half the time. Better tools, smarter workflows, focused blocks.

**Level 3: Effectiveness**  
10x the output, same time. Delegate. Automate. Build systems that work while you sleep.

**Level 4: Right Target**  
But wait—what if shipping 100 features was never the real goal?
What if it was just a proxy for building a sustainable business?
Skip the proxy. Go straight for what matters.

## The Ultimate Question

You've built the business. It runs itself. Your metrics are up and to the right.

Now ask yourself: Has this made you more fulfilled?

The highest leverage isn't just about doing less to achieve more.
It's about choosing what's worth achieving in the first place.

Before optimizing how to reach your goals, ask yourself:
- What am I optimizing for that won't matter in 5 years?
- If I could only accomplish one thing this year, what would create the most meaning?
- Am I climbing the ladder efficiently, or is it leaning against the wrong wall?

Focus isn't about doing more things well.
It's about doing the right thing for the right reason.
