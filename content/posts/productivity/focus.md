There are X hours in a day. My goal is to achieve Y.
I can stay busy working some high % of X and get Y done. 
Y can also be achieved using lesser time by increasing my productivity.
I can also achieve Y using even lesser time by being effective. Effective at delegation or automation.

Now what if Y wasn't goal after all?
Y was means to Z?
I can shoot for Z directly, bypassing Y. Selecting between Y and Z makes me more valuable in the same X hours.

Ultimately, Z is achieved. Now, the question is.. has Z made me more fulfilled?
