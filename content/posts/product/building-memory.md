Talentprism supports a suite of features that currently seem disjointed. This post is to track the thread that unifies this into a product that can create significant step-function improvement in recruting metrics.


Jobs to be done: this is not exhaustive, but dominates a recruiters mindshare.

Inbound
- When a candidate calls the recruiters, quailfy the caller and transfer to recruiter with context.
- When a candidate applies for a job, collect additional info to qualify the candidate
- When a candidate starts a chat session on website, guide them to the job they are looking for while enriching profile

Outbound
- When a job order comes in, find list of candidates in db who match the job description
- contact them to check availability and acceptance
- schedule reminders to candidates for appointments and missing information


The unifying piece that enables all these different interactions in an intelligent, natural and is memory.
