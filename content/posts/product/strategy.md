**Flow 1 - Sourcing jobs**
Exa websets to scrape jobs
Extract structured data

**Flow 2- Distribution - FB groups**
Structured job data to FB post
Invite/engage members
Post to FB daily
VA to fuel organic posts
Partner with agencies offering "free advertising" seeding parnerships

**Flow 3- Distribution - Tiktok**
Structured job data to tiktok script
TTS api + nano banana to create video
Post to tiktok daily
Find some welder video creators who can post reels
Repurpose best ones as Reels / Shorts.

**Flow 4- CTA on all posts to text a no.**
Funnel replies to profile aquisition, resume collection
Build talent pool

**Flow 5- microsites that lists job and funnels to text chatbot**
Hyper-focused pages:
PascagoulaShipyardJobs, NorfolkShipyardJobs, etc.

Now, we have a thriving community and growing talent pool. 

**Flow 6- Simple “free promo” offer to agencies:**

“Send us your hottest 3 reqs a week. We’ll post them to [FB group] + TikTok and send you click / lead stats.”

Over time:
“Pay to feature jobs”
“Pay to tap into our SMS pool”
“Pay to have our bot pre-screen your leads”



**What next?**
Pick a wedge:
  “Pascagoula shipyard Welder Jobs" or
  “Newport News Shipyard Welding Jobs”

Define a simple goal for 30 days, like:
  300 FB group members in this niche
  50 people text the number
  20 complete profiles / resumes collected

Implement a thin slice of each flow:
  Scrape 2–3 sites, not 20
  Post 1–2 FB posts/day, not 10
  3 TikToks/week, not daily perfect content
  One simple SMS flow
  One simple microsite

Review every week:
  What posts brought the most texts?
  What jobs people actually click?
  Which locations/trades respond?

Then iterate.
