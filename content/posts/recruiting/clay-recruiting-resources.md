Clay has become an increasingly popular tool for recruiters looking to automate and enhance their outreach processes. This post compiles essential resources for recruiters getting started with Clay and related tools.

### Getting Started with Clay

For those new to Clay, Letcia Berry from Fox Recruiting has created an excellent beginner-friendly video series that walks through the basics of using Clay in a recruiting context. You can find her tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv8k5LU7BRg).

### Advanced Clay Techniques

#### Job Mover Outreach Strategy
Clay offers a sophisticated tutorial on how to personalize outreach to former bosses of recent job movers. This strategy can be particularly effective for:
- Identifying potential hiring managers
- Understanding reporting structures
- Building meaningful connections through shared professional history
