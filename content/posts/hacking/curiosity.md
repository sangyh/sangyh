gogole keep note- I just watched a video with Sharif on AI engineer YouTube channel and it was about how we are we have given. We've been given these Rich tools and we don't understand the capabilities including the people who created them. So this is a really rich area for mining for potential products, businesses and expanding the frontier of how we operate as as humans better and how we interface with technology. So he shared a few demos and he spoke about how curiosity and curiosity doing thinking and working on demos is so important because you don't know where the link is because they're so capable and a lot of us are still doing the same things that everybody else is doing. For example, agents is all the buzz to calling coding, lighting emails, blogs and so on and he for example showed demos of how he used the lgbt3 to generate. You know Dr web pages how now this was back in 2020 and how now he's using Gemini to basically do the old-time our video tracking so he can shoot a basketball and he can give it back tips on how to include so it's crazy right? So this is like almost like a reset your brain kind of for thought. So it got me thinking about what is my rector and I need to select a vector. The horizon is pretty broad of the capabilities. It could be voice. AI could be readable learning. It could be pretending it could be agents could be documents you know like heavily Business vertical is probably like a distraction. So I think just abstracting out like that layer of like the application layer I need to select like a vector and for me I think that's something like the ux pattern is basically engaging with the AI with voice. So you know and this can be in sort of/ so basically I can have a conversation with the AI and it can be for interview. It can be for for making my online portfolio. I'll keeping it updated as we discussed. With superstar so basically if I build and engaging and robust, why say I pipeline and become an expert at that I can use that of course I join talentism Superstar and also maybe have my own sort of second plane layer where I talk to my AI and ask it to refer back to my notes or my thoughts and ideas and things like that. So I think that's a bit exciting were last in the last year and then now becoming good and voice high. Also compounds with the implement and models and agents so I think that is exciting. I think one thing to always question is is that is that like is this where are we at the point where it's not good enough today but it will be good enough for you ever too for now and I think that's two for y sayi and also it should not be like completely deviating from what I've been working on. Like for example video talking with Gemini. I don't think an owl apps well with what I what I have so far, so I should instead just focus on. You know interactive AI and I can imagine I can also use like voice apps across the stack. So once I get this down to atI can use it. For example rbd or radio editor jobs. I don't know you know the opportunity space because this is more like a boilerplate and I can just spin up apps across the accounts defend domains right? So or maybe on API that I use across my own apps in different verticals that's exciting



Tiny experiements notes

[6/21/25, 9:10:58 AM] Sangy: In order to switch from a linear mindset to an experimental mindset, change the goal setting framework from smart to pact 


Smart : specific measurable, assignable, relatable and timely

Pact: purposeful actionable continuous and trackable
[6/21/25, 9:13:57 AM] Sangy: Practice mindful productivity encourage curiosity over productivity. Productivity is not a virtue. Do not set 5-year goals. Treat the journey itself as a series of goals
[6/21/25, 9:15:30 AM] Sangy: Weeks of the time are not equally important, so you're not being right as a series of weeks. Instead different weeks or different meanings seminal events or important periods inflections in your life are way more important and so life seems much longer and more meaningful if you treat this way
[6/21/25, 9:50:55 AM] Sangy: Ask how we feel about any task, especially if you're procrastinating. 
If how we perceive it based on head heart in hand.

Head - is the task appropriate 
Heart-Is it exciting?
Hand- is it doable?
