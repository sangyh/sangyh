Rightjoin began as an automated interviewing tool designed to help recruiters pre-qualify candidates without spending hours on initial interviews. The original concept focused on saving recruiters time by conducting preliminary interviews and providing detailed reports on candidate responses.

After gathering feedback and analyzing market needs, I'm rebuilding Rightjoin as a comprehensive Interview Readiness Platform that serves both sides of the interview equation - candidates preparing for interviews and recruiters seeking qualified talent.

## Core Problem We're Solving

The interview process remains inefficient for both parties:

- **For candidates**: Preparation is fragmented, inconsistent, and lacks personalization
- **For recruiters**: Too much time spent on unqualified candidates and repetitive screening
- **For both**: Misalignment between skills, expectations, and communication
