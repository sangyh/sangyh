# Another banger week in AI

## Introduction

Crazy week in AI. this is what it feels like-

## The Major Players

### Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro

Gemini 2.5 Pro beats Sonnet 3.7 in all benchmarks. Clean Sweep.

### OpenAI's Native Image Generation

ChatGPT/GPT4o released native image gen and it is truly flawless. I have seen the most number of "wow" tweets from recent memory including from the hard to please crowd.

The latter has overshadowed former in a big way. People like Balaji tweeting about this being a huge inflection point.

## The Commoditization of Design

- Design is now a commodity. see thread for examples - [Greg Isenberg's thread](https://x.com/gregisenberg/status/1904980934794813667)
- Yes, literally creativity is the only barrier - [see this example](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gm_qpioXcAAH6z4?format=jpg&name=large)
- Can do ecom product mockups - [example from Alex](https://x.com/alexgoughcooper/status/1904870196369564128)
- Can do ad copies, Nico is already selling AI ads - [check it out](https://x.com/nico_jeannen/status/1905274655029792871)
- Interior design is trivial - [as Ethan shows](https://x.com/emollick/status/1905592064827404460)

## Other Developments

### OpenAI Adopts MCP

Sam Altman tweeted saying OpenAI will adopt MCP. A reminder to dive into MCP.

### Nomic's New Embedding Model

In a distant third (fourth?), Nomic released a new SOTA embedding model. Visualizing unstructured data remains unsolved, businesses treasure their data, but restricted to search which requires knowing what to search for. I have always loved clustering as a way to visualize unstructured data, so this occupies a tiny corner of my mind.

## Final Thoughts

All this will be eaten up by openai/google/facebook etc, so note to self to not get distracted.
