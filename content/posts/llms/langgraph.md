AI Agents are powerful and everybody should know about them.


I mean, my goal in the first part of the year is to build a bunch of agents to get deeply familiar with its flaws and its edge cases. Part that I think I need to internalize is whether they can, how can we make them do something in a loop or do something multiple times, right? So an agent, what I'm seeing is it takes one input and it performs an action or does whatever it does and returns an output. What if there are 100 inputs? We will have to invoke the agent. In parallel? But what is the--is there an agentic framework for that? Or is that something that is outside of the scope for those frameworks?
