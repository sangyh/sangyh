Cold emailing is a slightly different skill than writing given the target audience and the time consttraing to capture their attention. So everytime I write to someone, I feel disjointed in where I am on my learning curve and feel like I'm starting over again.
This post is to track my observations and learnings here.   

#### A good email

So, my starting point here is the following structure for a good cold email.

- Why you - Why am I messaging you?
- Why me - Why should you listen to me?
- Impact - What happens if we work together?

Nailing this will hopefully solve the "bad email" problem and attribute poor response rates to the pitch itself.


#### Variations

Here are some variations on the components that can be mixed and matched:

1. Why you:
   - "I noticed your company is hiring for [position]. Are you struggling to find qualified candidates?"
   - "As someone leading [department/function], I imagine you're always looking for ways to improve your hiring process."
   - "Given your experience in [industry], I thought you might be interested in a new approach to candidate screening."

2. Why me:
   - "I've developed an AI-powered interviewing tool that's helping companies like yours save 80% of time spent on initial screenings."
   - "My background in [relevant field] led me to create a solution that addresses the pain points I experienced firsthand in hiring."
   - "Our platform has already helped [X] companies reduce their time-to-hire by [Y]%."

3. Impact:
   - "Would you be open to a 15-minute demo to see how we could streamline your hiring process?"
   - "I'd love to show you how our tool could help you identify top candidates faster. When would be a good time for a quick chat?"
   - "If you're interested in cutting your screening time in half, I'd be happy to share some case studies from similar companies."

#### Best Practices

1. Personalization: Always tailor the email to the recipient's specific role and company.
2. Brevity: Keep the email concise, ideally no more than 3-4 short paragraphs.
3. Clear CTA: End with a clear, low-commitment call-to-action.
4. Follow-up: Plan for a follow-up sequence if you don't receive a response.
5. Value proposition: Focus on the benefit to the recipient, not just features of your product.

Remember, the goal is to start a conversation, not to make a sale in the first email.

#### Some templates

Adopting this to RightJoin, here are some templates for each component that I can use -
