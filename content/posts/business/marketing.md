#### Problem selection
Marketing starts with product and pain point.

Checklist before starting to build a product:
-1 major customer insight
- 1 distribution channel to get atleast 10 paying users for validation
- qualifiers for product
- i am interested in this problem
- - easy to build (<1 month)
- - 1 major customer insight that is not well known 
- - is a painkiller not a vitamin 
- - - solves critical need
- - - customer faces major negative consequence if not done correctly
- - - b2b
- - - they need to use it daily/weekly
- - - sounds boring


#### Marketing Strategy
Don't follow "launch and see what sticks"

Checklist for Strategy
- What one problem am I solving?
- What audience segment craves a solution like
my product the most?
- What's the current go-to solution for this
problem?
- What's good and bad about it?
- How is my product better than the current
alternatives?
- What pricing is a no-brainer for my audience and
still a good deal for me?
- How will I get my first 10 customers?


#### Marketing channels
Without existing audience, cold email is best for initial customers.
Initially, offer for free in exchange for feedback
If product solves real pain point, they will use it. Eventually they will pay for it.
Everything else, like SEO, PH, ads, etc. comes later. First nail the problem you're solving. Then focus on defining the ICP.

#### Landing Page 

Follow this template:
Bullet-proof landing page structure:

ðŸ”¹ Hero block
â€¢ Heading 1 with a value proposition 
â€¢ Product description with an explanation of how the promised value will be delivered
â€¢ Product visual (loom-style demo / gif / screenshot) that shows the product in action
â€¢ 1 CTA button (avoid words like "buy" and "purchase")
â€¢ Quick social proof (number of customers / average rating / 1-sentence testimonial)

ðŸ”¹ Problem agitation
â€¢ Status-quo solution that your product "fights"
â€¢ 3 negative consequences of sticking to the status-quo solution

ðŸ”¹ Transformation
â€¢ Alternative product visual to illustrate your product (can be a "how it works" block)
â€¢ 3 positive benefits of switching to your product

ðŸ”¹ Social proof
â€¢ 3-7 testimonials from satisfied customers (face, role, highlighted key points)
â€¢ Advanced: get 1-3 endorsements from opinion leaders

ðŸ”¹ Features
â€¢ 3-4 groups of features so users can remember them easily
â€¢ Focus on selling sub-benefits with details of how each feature delivers the promised sub-value
â€¢ Add specific visuals (bonus points for gifs) to illustrate every feature

ðŸ”¹ About us
â€¢ Share your "why" to build affinity
â€¢ 2-3 paragraphs of storytelling + your face

ðŸ”¹ Pricing
â€¢ 2-3 pricing plans (always an upsell plan, sometimes a downsell plan)
â€¢ End the price at $9 or $7 ($0 if luxury)
â€¢ Each pricing plan must have 3-5 specific conditions 
â€¢ Clarify if this is a subscription or a one-time payment
â€¢ Clarify your money-back guarantee 

ðŸ”¹ FAQ
