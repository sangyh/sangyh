Problem selection
Marketing starts with product and pain point.

Checklist before starting to build a product:
-1 major customer insight
- 1 distribution channel to get atleast 10 paying users for validation
- qualifiers for product
- i am interested in this problem
- - easy to build (<1 month)
- - 1 major customer insight that is not well known 
- - is a painkiller not a vitamin 
- - - solves critical need
- - - customer faces major negative consequence if not done correctly
- - - b2b
- - - they need to use it daily/weekly
- - - sounds boring


Marketing Strategy
Don't follow "launch and see what sticks"

Checklist for Strategy
- What one problem am I solving?
- What audience segment craves a solution like
my product the most?
- What’s the current go-to solution for this
problem?
- What’s good and bad about it?
- How is my product better than the current
alternatives?
- What pricing is a no-brainer for my audience and
still a good deal for me?
- How will I get my first 10 customers?


3 Marketing channels
Without existing audience, cold email is best for initial customers.
Initially, offer for free in exchange for feedback
If product solves real pain point, they will use it. Eventually they will pay for it.
Everything else, like SEO, PH, ads, etc. comes later. First nail the problem you're solving. Then focus on defining the ICP.

4. Landing Page 

Follow this template:
Bullet-proof landing page structure:

🔹 Hero block
• Heading 1 with a value proposition 
• Product description with an explanation of how the promised value will be delivered
• Product visual (loom-style demo / gif / screenshot) that shows the product in action
• 1 CTA button (avoid words like "buy" and "purchase")
• Quick social proof (number of customers / average rating / 1-sentence testimonial)

🔹 Problem agitation
• Status-quo solution that your product "fights"
• 3 negative consequences of sticking to the status-quo solution

🔹 Transformation
• Alternative product visual to illustrate your product (can be a "how it works" block)
• 3 positive benefits of switching to your product

🔹 Social proof
• 3-7 testimonials from satisfied customers (face, role, highlighted key points)
• Advanced: get 1-3 endorsements from opinion leaders

🔹 Features
• 3-4 groups of features so users can remember them easily
• Focus on selling sub-benefits with details of how each feature delivers the promised sub-value
• Add specific visuals (bonus points for gifs) to illustrate every feature

🔹 About us
• Share your "why" to build affinity
• 2-3 paragraphs of storytelling + your face

🔹 Pricing
• 2-3 pricing plans (always an upsell plan, sometimes a downsell plan)
• End the price at $9 or $7 ($0 if luxury)
• Each pricing plan must have 3-5 specific conditions 
• Clarify if this is a subscription or a one-time payment
• Clarify your money-back guarantee 

🔹 FAQ
• 5-7 objections that bother your audience
• Answer each one straightforwardly and concisely


Other landing page tips:
Your landing page is not about your product. It’s about what your customers will get from using your product
Replace “we” and “our” with “you” and “your”
Showcase good product visuals that make people want to try your product
Record a Loom-style product video with your comments
Write a Founder message explaining “why” you build this product
Add more social proof so people believe what you say
Follow this copy structure “Emotional heading with a promise” + “Straightforward description explaining how the promise will delivered”
Use only 3-4 colors on your landing page
Limit any listicles (features / integrations) to 3-5 points — people won’t remember more
Make the next action simple and desirable
Remove “subscribe to get our updates” from the bottom of your landing page
Stop being arrogant in your marketing copy (your tool is not the best in the market, relax)
Don’t make your landing page wide — it’s hard to read
Don't undersell (free trial, money back guarantee etc)

4. Writing Marketing Copy

Start with an emotion - people don't buy features, they want to achieve something. Target that emotion of achieving something. 
Following rational explanation - how do u help achieve that. 

emotion - "unqualified applicants take up your time?"
