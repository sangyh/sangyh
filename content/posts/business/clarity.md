1. RARE and Valuable
2. Fulfill human desires
3. Spot human desires by watching what they do (Revealed preferences)
4. Desires always remain, no market is "DONE"

**Tactics**

1. Serve the dissatisfied minority
↳ Mainstream does not serve them. (Beachhead)
2. Cannot create desires, only satisfy them
make it easier, faster, cheaper for people to do what they're already doing
3. Don't make people work harder.
Always reduce effort, not increase motivation
4. Satisfy core motivations effortlessly
↓
more people
↓
more successful.
5. Significantly increase efficiency in satisfying desire.
