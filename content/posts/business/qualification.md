Set the backdrop. Prospect is a big company interested in my product. The have set up a call. 

_My goal, as the founder, is to understand their problem as deeply as possible. If they are the right profile of customer, the job is to them convince them that you can help them._

"Hi, let me start with a brief overview of my product to set the context and we can then go deeper. Rightjoin is an automated interviewing tool that can take the burden of prequalification off your shoulders. So you don't spend a single minute on unqualified candidates or waste hours trying to find a good slot on your calendar."

"so how do we qualify candidates? well you define what qualification means to you. be it just making sure they're a real person, collecting logistics like location, certifications, etc. or even more specific skill-based screening like personality and profieciency.
Rightjoin will take your interview questions, talk to the candidate, analyze their responses and give you a detailed report."

"the best part- it doesn't feel like talking to a bot."


what is the pricing?

Let's say the hourly rate for a recruiter is $25. they spend 30 mins on a candidate. 


Initial resume screening:

HR staff spends 5 minutes per resume
500 resumes * 5 minutes = 42 hours
At $25/hour for HR staff = $1100


Phone screening (assuming top 10% of applicants):

15-minute calls for 50 candidates
50 * 15 minutes = 12.5 hours
At $25/hour for HR staff = $312.5


Time spent scheduling interviews: 

15 min * 50 candidates = 12.5 hours
At $25/hour = $312.5


Total time: 67 hours
