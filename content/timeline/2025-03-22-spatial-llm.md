this one caught my attention. the applications in civil engineering and architecture (my background) are immense. tagging this note from the the AINews newsletter.

```
SpatialLM is a large language model specifically designed to enhance 3D scene understanding using Llama 1B. The model focuses on improving spatial comprehension, potentially offering advancements in applications that require detailed environmental awareness.

SpatialLM Capabilities: SpatialLM processes 3D point cloud data to generate structured scene understanding, identifying architectural elements like walls and doors and classifying objects with semantic categories. It works with various data sources, including monocular videos, RGBD images, and LiDAR sensors, making it versatile for applications in robotics and navigation.

Technical Queries and Clarifications: Discussions raised questions about the classification of SpatialLM as a language model, given its processing of non-human readable data. It was clarified that it outputs structured 3D object graphs, which is a specific form of language, and is based on Llama 1B and Qwen 0.5B.

Model Performance and Applications: Users expressed amazement at the model's capabilities with only 1.25 billion parameters and discussed potential applications, such as integration with text-to-speech for the visually impaired and use in robot vacuum cleaners. The model's ability to estimate object heights and its potential for integration into reasoning models were also highlighted.
