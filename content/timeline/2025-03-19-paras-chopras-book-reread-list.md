I usually keep a note of reasources recommended by someone if it seemed interesting, but later forget who recommended it & why. This context is part of the reason why somehting was interested in the first place.
For example, this book re-read list was a tweet following his podcast episode - https://x.com/paraschopra/status/1901675272103145565
