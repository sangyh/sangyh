TalentPrism is an AI-powered candidate engagement platform that creates a compounding data flywheel for recruitment agencies. Rather than requiring deep ATS integrations, we become the system of intelligence that sits alongside existing ATS systems, enriching candidate data through AI conversations and building a growing talent intelligence layer.

### The TalentPrism Flywheel
Instead of just integrating with ATS to perform point-in-time actions, **TalentPrism will be the system of intelligence on top of their system of record for candidate engagement data.**

```
1. Agency uploads candidates → 
2. AI conducts outreach & conversations → 
3. Profiles enriched with insights → 
4. Data improves matching → 
5. Better matches for future jobs → 
1. Higher quality campaigns
```

Each campaign makes future campaigns more effective by:
- Verifying contact information
- Understanding candidate preferences
- Tracking response patterns
- Building relationship history
- Capturing real-time availability
- Extracting actual vs. claimed skills
