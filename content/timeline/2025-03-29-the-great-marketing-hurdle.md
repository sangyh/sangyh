That's some tweets from Danny Postma and just throwing my thoughts into this note. 

> People hate marketing sales so much that just talking about your product normally and frequently sets you apart from the 99 percent already.

This applies 100% for me. What they do best is their marketing doesn't feel like marketing at all - it's just honest communication about what they're built and why it matters. 

So some rules to follow here:
- genuinely believe in your product and its value : **message**
- Show up where your customers are : **channel**
- articulate its value clearly :  **copy**
