Seeing an early customer come back after two years is one of the most validating moments for a solo founder.

Yesterday, one of my first users from the rightjoin (almost 2 years ago) re-subscribed as she was back in the job market. Back then - she had signed up for the $19.99 plan, and shared how much she found the interviews useful as well as a testimonial, which still lives on the landing page today. She found a job and unsubscribed after 3 or 4 months.
I decided to look up some of those emails and found this:

So, it was a pleasant surprise to see her email pop back up and later discover she had subscribed again. I responded back saying while Rightjoin hadn't evolved much since she last used it, the core experience she loved is still there, and she's happy to use it nonetheless.

This reinforces my plans for Rightjoin, and to nudge me to get Rightjoin 2.0 out asap. 

### What is Rightjoin 2.0?
While voice AI tools have become prevalent over the past 12 months, there is plenty of room for innovation. There is growing evidence that users seek help and are willing to share information with AI given it's non-judgemental, all-knowing and ever-present nature. My experience from running Rightjoin and Talentprism backs this. The friction users face, if there were to use ChatGPT, is in giving it the right context for it be useful. The innovation, therefore, is in engineering this context for the AI that makes it personal, relatable and smart to help them improve with micro-advice. 

This is how I landed on an `interview twin` model. While a coach by itself can be effective, a twin that can double up as a coach could prove to be the USP of rightjoin 2.0. Rightjoin in its early days had a feature that let users simulate their own responses in a mock interview, to provide answers contextual to their resume, and it was a hit. This let them see what a possible response would sound like, and how likely they were to give that response. The interview twin recreates this, while also growing in relevance with more interaction to track the user's progress.

It is clear that continuity is important for the relationship to develop. And so, a better model for rightjoin is a lifetime-access interview prep tool, where the users grow attached to their interview twin as in turn, the twin gets to really know the user's work profile. I hesitate to call it a career coach, as I think an interview twin is a more effective tool targeted at improving interviewing skills - nothing more. 

Users will naturally use it more during career switches, but they will return to their twin to find out how much their interviewing skills have eroded, and quickly work it back into gear.
