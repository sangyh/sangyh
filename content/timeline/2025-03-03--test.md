How are you doing? I am doing well. What about you? I am doing well too.
Once upon a time, in a small village nestled among rolling hills, there lived a curious young girl named Luna. She had a peculiar hobby of collecting fallen stars - or at least, that's what she believed the shimmering stones she found in her garden were.

Every night, Luna would sit by her window, watching the sky with wide eyes. One particularly special evening, she witnessed something extraordinary: a real shooting star that seemed to land just beyond the old oak tree at the edge of the village.

Without hesitation, she snuck out of her house, tiptoeing through the dewy grass. When she reached the oak tree, she found not a star, but a tiny, glowing butterfly with wings that sparkled like stardust.

From that day forward, Luna learned that magic wasn't always what it seemed - but that didn't make it any less magical.
