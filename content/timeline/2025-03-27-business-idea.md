Some verison of this has been rattling around in my head for a while. 

AI is a great sparring partner, better than a one-sided internal monologue and safer/easier than finding a human to chat with.
AI is great at critique, reflection and brainstorming.
AI knows a ton more than me. 

AI mock interviews started with this premise. But that's just job interviews.

Case in point: I don't have a pipeline of content. But i replying to an email gets me thinking like no other, as I re-discovered talking to Brian about the UI for AI agents. Productize this!

Some variant of this could be great for:
- creating content by interviewing domain experts. - https://x.com/codyschneiderxx/status/1904668855470809486
- interviewing an individuals family and friends as a gift for a special occasion (memorylane.art?)
- people love to elevate sense of self - imagine a conversation (debate/podcast/interview) with an AI that makes them appear like a celebrity!
