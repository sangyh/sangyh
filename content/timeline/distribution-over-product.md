Competitors with inferior products would always do more revenue than me. 

It made me mad. 

Then I realised, good products are useless if you don't focus on distributing them.

We now focus mostly on distribution and are doing better than ever. 

The sooner you get this mindset out of your mind, the earlier you'll reach your goals.
