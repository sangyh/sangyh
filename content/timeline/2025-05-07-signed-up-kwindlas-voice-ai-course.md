# Signed up Kwindla's Voice AI course

For a course fee of $400, I get $500 in Vapi credits,  $500 in deepgram credits, and a whole bunch of other platform credits, but just Vapi and Deepgram make this a no brainer.

I'll have to watch the courses async on my own time, but excited to learn the SOTA and industry best practices none the less.
