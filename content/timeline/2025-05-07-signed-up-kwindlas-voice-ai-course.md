A lot of the material seems to be an overlap with the excellent [Voice AI and Voice Agents](https://voiceaiandvoiceagents.com/) that they released a while back. Fwiw, the guide itself is great overview of current state of the voice AI industry, and probably deserves an hour lecture on each chapter.
