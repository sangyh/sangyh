Some thoughts sparked listening to the SIP podcast with Andrew Wilkinson. 
- building an arbirtage mindset 
    - one idea shared was to use v0 or lovable to build websites for local businesses for literally zero cost and pitch them to buy a hosted version for a subcription fee. they see a superior website for their own company and left with no reason not to buy it.
- really easy to build a business today, and those are the worst businesses as there's no moat. most AI companies today are 1-2 year businesses but 5-10 year businesses. competition will skyrocket as barrier to code lowers and equtiy value will tend to 0.
- the only moats are network effects, brand, and data. buildng an audience is an unfair advantage.
- Andrew speaking about MCP speaks to how mainstream even the bleeding edge of AI already is. 

- well, either that, we are all part of the same bubble that is early - https://x.com/hnshah/status/1904900551785275577
