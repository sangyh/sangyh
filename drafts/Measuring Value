THe goal is have a pilot report that clearly demonstrates the value that is otherwise lost in dashboards and emails. The decision makers are not logging into these dashboards or diving into data. They want a clear snapshot within 30 secs. 
So the next immediate goal for me with Talentprism is to demonstrate this value.

An adequate value measuring system - 
- measurable metrics
- change over time

A good value measuring system shows why they should care. What does that mean in their business? Which metric maps to which client business line item?


### Outreach Summary
deliverability rates range fall 80-90%  for SMS and 90%+ for emails. This is a indicator of contact quality. 
response rates for SMS campaigns between 7-12 % - continues to be a promising channel compared to email.
responses indicate job interest or want to sign up for job alerts between 60-70%  of the responses. 
median time for replies is between 20 mins to 2 hours. this means we can move fast with qualified candidates
unsubscribe rate is very low <2.5%
