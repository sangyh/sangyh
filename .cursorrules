# Cursor Rules

I have notes in the /notes directory, each note is in atomic format.

You have several tools at your disposal:
- format_transcript.py: formats text nicely into a markdown file
- plan_to_split_atomic.py: splits a long text file into atomic notes
- enhanced_search.py: performs multi-modal search (exact, fuzzy, and semantic) across notes and sources
- search_cli.py: command-line interface for enhanced_search.py, making it easier to search through notes
- readwise_to_atomic.py: converts Readwise exports into atomic notes with proper formatting and metadata

If I ask you to do a task, you should first determine if the task is possible with the tools you have. If it is, you should do the task with the tool.

If it's possible to do it without a tool, just do it. If you need to write a tool to do the task well, suggest that along with a plan for the tool. If you write a new tool, make sure to update this cursor rules file with the new tool.

If I ask you to do a comprehensive search for something, use enhanced_search.py first to find relevant content quickly. If needed, you can still go through notes manually as a fallback.
